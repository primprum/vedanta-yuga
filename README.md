# René Guénon's View on Vedanta

Vedanta, a philosophical system within Hinduism, is closely related to René Guénon's views in several ways, particularly in their shared emphasis on metaphysical principles and the perennial philosophy.

<br>

### Perennial Philosophy:

Both Vedanta and Guénon advocate for the idea of a perennial philosophy, which posits that there is a universal and timeless truth that underlies all authentic spiritual traditions.

Guénon argues that this perennial philosophy can be found at the heart of various religious and metaphysical teachings throughout history, including Vedanta. Similarly, Vedanta holds that there is a unity underlying the diversity of religious and philosophical traditions, and it seeks to uncover this universal truth through self-inquiry and spiritual realization.

### Metaphysical Principles:

Vedanta and Guénon share a focus on metaphysical principles as the foundation of reality. Vedanta teaches the concept of Brahman, the ultimate reality that transcends all distinctions and forms the essence of existence.

Guénon similarly emphasizes the importance of transcendent metaphysical truths and argues that the material world is ultimately grounded in a higher spiritual reality. Both Vedanta and Guénon emphasize the importance of transcending worldly illusions and realizing the underlying unity of all existence.

### Spiritual Realization:

Vedanta and Guénon both advocate for the importance of spiritual realization or enlightenment as the ultimate goal of human existence.

Vedanta teaches methods such as self-inquiry (Atma-Vichara) and meditation to attain direct realization of the true nature of the self (Atman) and its identity with Brahman. Guénon similarly emphasizes the need for spiritual realization as a means of transcending the limitations of the material world and attaining union with the divine.

### Critique of Modernity:

Both Vedanta and Guénon offer critiques of modernity and its materialistic worldview.

Guénon argues that the modern world has lost touch with traditional metaphysical truths and has become increasingly dominated by materialism and secularism. Similarly, Vedanta critiques the attachment to worldly pursuits and the identification with transient aspects of existence, emphasizing the need to transcend these limitations and realize one's true spiritual nature.

### [Summary]

Overall, while Vedanta and Guénon come from different cultural and religious backgrounds, they share a common emphasis on metaphysical principles, spiritual realization, and the critique of modernity. Their teachings offer insights into the timeless quest for understanding the nature of reality and the ultimate purpose of human existence.

## Between Dvaita, Vishishtadvaita, or Advaita Vedanta in René Guénon's View

When René Guénon discusses Vedanta, he primarily refers to Advaita Vedanta. Advaita Vedanta is a non-dualistic philosophical system within Hinduism, most notably associated with the teachings of Adi Shankaracharya.

Advaita Vedanta emphasizes the ultimate identity of the individual soul (Atman) with the universal Brahman, positing that there is only one absolute reality without any duality or differentiation.

### Non-dualistic perspective

Guénon was particularly drawn to the non-dualistic perspective of Advaita Vedanta, as it aligns closely with his own understanding of metaphysical principles and the unity underlying all existence. He saw Advaita Vedanta as expressing profound metaphysical truths about the nature of reality and the ultimate goal of human existence, which he believed were consistent with the perennial philosophy found in various spiritual traditions.

While Guénon's discussions of Vedanta primarily focus on Advaita Vedanta, he also acknowledges the significance of other Vedantic traditions such as Dvaita Vedanta and Vishishtadvaita Vedanta. However, his emphasis on non-dualism and the unity of all existence aligns most closely with the teachings of Advaita Vedanta.

<br>

### [Summary]

René Guénon favored Advaita Vedanta for its non-dualistic perspective, aligning with his belief in the unity of existence. Although he acknowledged other Vedantic traditions, such as Dvaita and Vishishtadvaita, Advaita's emphasis on a singular, undifferentiated reality resonated most with his metaphysical principles.

## Kali Yuga cosmology

René Guénon's belief that humanity is currently in the last cycle, particularly referencing the concept of the Kali Yuga from Hindu cosmology, is rooted in his interpretation of traditional metaphysical teachings and his analysis of the spiritual state of the modern world. Here's a breakdown of his reasoning:

### The Concept of the Yugas

In Hindu cosmology, time is conceptualized as cyclical, with the universe passing through four distinct epochs known as the Yugas: Satya Yuga, Treta Yuga, Dvapara Yuga, and Kali Yuga. These epochs represent different phases of spiritual evolution, with each successive Yuga characterized by a decline in moral and spiritual values.

#### The Kali Yuga:

The Kali Yuga, often referred to as the "Age of Darkness" or the "Age of Quarrel," is considered the last and most degenerate of the Yugas. It is characterized by widespread spiritual ignorance, moral decay, and societal chaos.

According to Hindu tradition, the Kali Yuga is marked by the dominance of materialism, falsehood, and spiritual decline.

#### Guénon's Interpretation:

Guénon interprets the concept of the Kali Yuga not only as a literal period of time but also as a symbolic representation of the spiritual state of humanity. He sees the modern world as exhibiting many of the characteristics associated with the Kali Yuga, including materialism, moral degradation, and a loss of spiritual values.

Guénon argues that the prevalence of secularism, individualism, and skepticism in the modern era reflects a deep-seated spiritual malaise characteristic of the Kali Yuga.

#### The Last Cycle:

Guénon suggests that the Kali Yuga represents the final phase of the cosmic cycle before the onset of a new cycle of spiritual regeneration. He views the Kali Yuga as a necessary phase in the cosmic order, serving as a period of purification and dissolution before the emergence of a new golden age.

Guénon believes that the degeneracy of the Kali Yuga will eventually reach its culmination, leading to a spiritual awakening and the dawn of a new cycle of spiritual evolution.

<br>

### [Summary]

René Guénon's belief that humanity is currently in the last cycle, as indicated by the Kali Yuga, reflects his interpretation of traditional metaphysical teachings and his analysis of the spiritual condition of the modern world. He sees the prevalence of materialism and spiritual decline as indicative of the characteristics associated with the Kali Yuga, and he envisions the eventual transition to a new cycle of spiritual regeneration.
